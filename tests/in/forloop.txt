## NOTE: currently, not printing anything from for loops.

# However, I would not be opposed to changing it such that for
# loops print all created values once done.
# (filtered similarly to loading files, i.e., only print 
# last value for each variable). 
# this would require careful change to code, 
# and a change to this test as well. 

# For now this test is here to verify consistency. 
# If you do change this behaviour, please give a PR focused on this 
# change alone
